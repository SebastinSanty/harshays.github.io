### Future TODOs

- Separate section for research interests (what I do/research interests) - see maithra raghu and irene chen’s website
- nice website: https://posobin.com/
- Custom google search
- https://fredzhang.me/, http://rowanzellers.com/, http://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/#irislab
- Eventually: blog and reading list in navigation bar, Add disqus and Jekyll to blog posts
- Adding a blog post: use newsprint and export. Then, in html file, add disqus blob with correct identifiers, change title
- Move to jekyll?
- Hide disqus posts (make it collapsible like [this](http://colah.github.io/posts/2019-05-Collaboration/index.html))
- templating (blog) with this theme: https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/

### Content

I’m a research fellow in the Machine Learning and Optimization group at Microsoft Research India, where I primarily work with Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli and Dr. Prateek Jain. Currently, my research focuses on understanding deep learning phenomena through systematic experiments and theoretical analysis.

Before joining Microsoft Research, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics from UIUC, where I was advised by Hari Sundaram, Sewoong Oh, and Sanmi Koyejo. 

My research interests broadly lie in theoretical machine learning and statistical inference. I’m also interested in optimization and game theory. Outside of research, I like to X, Y, and Z in my spare time. 

**Current**

- What are you doing now
  - I’m a research fellow in the XYZ group at Microsoft Research India, where I work with ABC and DEF. 
- What are you working on
  - I work in the field of ABC
  - My research is focused on blah and foo.
  - I am also interested in PQR

I’m a research fellow in the Machine Learning and Optimization group at Microsoft Research India, where I primarily work with Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli and Dr. Prateek Jain. My research focuses on understanding the training dynamics of deep neural nets.

**First Blog Post**

Title: Hello World/What to expect

This blog primarily functions as a collection of expository notes on topics and papers in machine learning that I find interesting or useful. I also plan to use it as a medium to share my research to a wider audience in an accessible manner. Excited to see how this pans out!
